# Dott-Assignment
This repository contains the solution to an assignment for a Data Science Intern position at Dott

## Summary
My task is to determine whether a model or improved heuristic would be a better solution for a distance estimate usecase.

Through the markdowns in the notebook, I try to:
-  expand upon my assumptions based of my research of the 2 approaches
- Give an overview of the 2 solutions:
 - Pros
 - Cons
-After my decision, I then explain my model selection briefly

A much better model definitely exists - but is likely **harder to maintain**(if modelled on internal company data, with regards to pre-processing, outlier factoring etc), and would take more than the scope of time required to complete the task

## Running the model
Create a comparison dataframe to have the results of the basic heuristic, the improved heuristic, and the model trained on the heuristics

## Checking efficiency
Implement a simple MSE check for the different approaches, and come to my inference

## Footnotes
Tried to include some resources I came across that influenced my decision
