    "These are some questions I formulated that could influence my choice:\n",
    "- Is there a possibility of large fluctuations of variables/metrics that could happen, for example, over:\n",
    "  - Different cities\n",
    "  - Different vehicle types?\n",

    "- What if a **KPI is added?**, one that differs across different markets?\n",
    "- ***The distance estimate varies across different vehicle types***, is it a good idea to hard-code a heuristic?\n",

    "- Flexibility - Adjust parameters to accommodate changing goals, constraints\n",

    "- Takes seasonality into account - important from a product perspective - Rides can boom/dip suring summer, for example\n",
    "- Already has some feature engineering built in  - for example, lag features - which could be essential if you want to account for the previous entry's possible rate of error - could handle the genuine bugs/outliers in the dataset\n",

    "Why Random Forest?\n",
    "- Could capture **Non-Linearity**. Relationships between **battery levels,vehicle types,ride usage across cities** could be non-linear\n",

    "- Establishing a **baseline to beat** could also lead to a better integrated solution - one that could be trained on an existing expectation of how large/small a KPI is set to\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why?\n",
    "The added advantages of training a model on a heuristic are:\n",
    "- Use a pre-coded heuristic with product know-how and decision making experience to generate a **good** solution\n",
    "- You don't need to let the model start from scratch. The model will either improve the heuristic or achieve optimality eventually"
